This is a unit test example to check if images are being correctly generated by the assembler. The images tested here were generated by uncommenting an invocation to method debug() at method step() of the class Environment. Method debug() saves the next state with X reads after finding a file named debugX.txt into /data folder. For example, after start the assembler, if we create a file named debug20.txt, the next state with 20 reads will be saved as an image inside /data. File script.sh shows how to test all the five approaches using images previously saved following this methodology.

Copy utils/test/check.py here and execute script.sh to try it.
