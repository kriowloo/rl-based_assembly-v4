Copy rescale_images.py and DejaVuSansMono-Bold.ttf files to this new folder and run rescale_images.py. To customize output, read comments inside this code.

After that, execute generate_video.sh. This execution will produce an output file named output.mp4 with the corresponding images. Note that ffmpeg has to be installed before executing this last step. If it is not installed and you are using Ubuntu, run apt-get install ffmpeg.
